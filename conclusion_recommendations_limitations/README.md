## Conclusion and Recommendations
### Conclusion:
* Job level plays important role in attrition of employees in Over 50 age group.
* Employees at Job Level 5 left with high job dissatisfaction, even though they were paid higher than the average.
* HR Employees at level 3 who left despite high pay felt unsatisfied with both the job and the environment, and they also received less training times last year than the average.
* Employees who serve less than or equal to 5 years at company left with highest vote on environment dissatisfaction. And these people also have low average working years per previous company. 

### Recommendations to reduce Attrition Rate:
* For employees who are over 50 years old, we should give them more opportunities to move up to higher job levels by: (1) increasing their job involvement, training times, (2) considering promotion based on their performance and contributions, (3) evaluating any transferrable skills from their previous jobs to offer them higher level in the recruitment phrase
* For employees that left with higher salary than average:
    * In Job Level 5: focus on how to improve their job satisfaction and job involvement
    * In Job Level 3 and under: provide more trainings to let them improve their skills at work 
* For employees within their first 5 years at company, we should focus on engaging them in organization culture and environment to boost employees experience.
* In the recruitment phrase: carefully consider all pros and cons when offer candidates who worked for average 2 years per previous company.

### Some  limitations in this dataset/ project:
* Performance Rating only has result of 3 or 4, with score 3 accounts for around 85% of the total. Therefore, it is not an applicable variable to analyze, which is a significant drawback because Performance Rating is important in assessing employees contributions and their work quality.
* Further data on the reasons why employees left will be useful. We can get that data by conducting exit interviews/ surveys. It is not clear in this dataset that whether employees left  due to more competitive offers, retirement age, or any other external factors.
